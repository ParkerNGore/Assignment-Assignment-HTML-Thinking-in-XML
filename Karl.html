  <h2>Biography</h2>
  <p>
    Originally from Wellington, New Zealand, Karl Urban now lives in Auckland.
    Born on June 7, 1972, he is the son of a leather-goods manufacturer (who had
    hoped that Karl would follow in his footsteps). His first acting role was
    when he was 8 -- he had a line on a television series. However, he did not
    act again until after high school. He was offered a role in the NZ soap
    opera Shortland Street (1992) as he was preparing to attend Victoria
    University. After appearing on the series for the 1993-1994 season, he
    attended the university for one year, then left to pursue his acting career.
    Over the next few years, he landed several theater roles in the Wellington
    area. Eventually, he moved to Auckland, where a number of guest roles in NZ
    television followed. One of his first roles was that of a heroin addict in
    the drama series Shark in the Park (1989). He was in a movie as well,
    entitled Once in Chunuck Bay (aka Chunuk Bair (1992)). Other television
    roles followed, including a guest-starring role in the series White Fang
    (1993). Karl's biggest roles include Ã‰omer in the Lord of the Rings trilogy,
    as well as Dr. Leonard "Bones" McCoy in Star Trek (2009), William Cooper in
    RED (2010) and Judge Dredd in Dredd (2012).
