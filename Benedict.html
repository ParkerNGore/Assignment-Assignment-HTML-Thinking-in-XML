  <h2>Biography</h2>
  <p>
    Benedict Timothy Carlton Cumberbatch was born and raised in London, England.
    His parents, Wanda Ventham and Timothy Carlton (born Timothy Carlton Congdon
    Cumberbatch), are both actors. He is a grandson of submarine commander Henry
    Carlton Cumberbatch, and a great-grandson of diplomat Henry Arnold
    Cumberbatch CMG. Cumberbatch attended Brambletye School and Harrow School.
    Whilst at Harrow, he had an arts scholarship and painted large oil canvases.
    It's also where he began acting. After he finished school, he took a year
    off to volunteer as an English teacher in a Tibetan monastery in Darjeeling,
    India. On his return, he studied drama at Manchester University. He
    continued his training as an actor at the London Academy of Music and
    Dramatic Art graduating with an M.A. in Classical Acting. By the time he had
    completed his studies, he already had an agent.
